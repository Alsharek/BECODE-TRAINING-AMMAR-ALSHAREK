# THE INTERNET

### The Internet is a world-wide network of computers.  It is an Information Superhighway that carries traffic to and from a collection of servers-- remote computers that handle requests for data and information, much like the waiter in a restaurant that takes orders for food.  This collection of servers distributed all over the world and is called the World Wide Web (WWW).  Servers respond to clients-- computers that request information, much like a customer in a restaurant orders food from the waiter.  You click links to text, pictures, music, or video located on these servers.

# HOW DOES IT WORK ?
### The internet is a worldwide computer network that transmits a variety of data and media across interconnected devices. It works by using a packet routing network that follows Internet Protocol (IP) and Transport Control Protocol (TCP) [5]
### TCP and IP work together to ensure that data transmission across the internet is consistent and reliable, no matter which device you’re using or where you’re using it.
### When data is transferred over the internet, it’s delivered in messages and packets. Data sent over the internet is called a message, but before messages get sent, they’re broken up into tinier parts called packets.
### These messages and packets travel from one source to the next using Internet Protocol (IP) and Transport Control Protocol (TCP). IP is a system of rules that govern how information is sent from one computer to another computer over an internet connection.
### Using a numerical address (IP Address) the IP system receives further instructions on how the data should be transferred.
### The Transport Control Protocol (TCP) works with IP to ensure transfer of data is dependable and reliable. This helps to make sure that no packets are lost, packets are reassembled in proper sequence, and there’s no delay negatively affecting the data quality.
